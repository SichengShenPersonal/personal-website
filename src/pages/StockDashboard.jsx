          This project showcases my full ownership of a cloud-based analytics system‚Äîarchitected, built, and delivered with a real-world mindset. It reflects not only my technical command of Python, SQL, and BI tools, but also my ability to design scalable architecture, optimize data usability, and bridge cloud infrastructure with business-facing insights.

                  Built entirely on Azure, the system automatically fetches stock data from the Polygon API, processes it through structured, batch-based ETL pipelines using Airflow, stores it in a multi-layered MySQL database, and delivers insights via both Tableau and a custom Dash dashboard. Every decision‚Äîfrom modeling to visualization‚Äîwas driven by performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

                  <li><strong>Cloud-native architecture:</strong> Fully deployed on Azure with Airflow running on Virtual Machines and MySQL Flexible Server serving as the central data store, ensuring scalability and reliability.</li>
                  <li><strong>Structured, traceable ETL pipeline:</strong> Built around traditional batch processing with a clearly layered design‚Äîseparating raw ingestion, transformation logic, and BI-ready modeling. Each stage is modular, logically scoped, and easily traceable, enabling full control, transparency, and fast issue tracking across the workflow.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dual visualization capabilities:</strong> Developed two parallel visualization solutions‚Äîone using Tableau to demonstrate proficiency in enterprise-grade BI tools and dashboard tuning, and the other using Dash to showcase my ability to build fully custom, code-driven visualizations integrated directly into a front-end application.</li>
                  <li><strong>Security & maintainability by design:</strong> Pipeline credentials are securely managed, code modules are cleanly separated, and the system is built for long-term extension, debugging, and operational transparency.</li>
                  <li><strong>Real-world execution mindset:</strong> From architecture to delivery, every design decision reflects the practical trade-offs and constraints of real-world data work‚Äîbalancing performance, usability, scalability, and maintainability. Challenges encountered during development were met with systematic debugging, solution testing, and thoughtful iteration.</li>
